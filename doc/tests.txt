some tests:

- Walk,Open,Create,Read,Write,Clunk,Stat,Remove,Wstat: send bogus fids not in use.

- Version: send tag other than NOTAG
- Version: bogus msize
- Version: send various bogus versions
- Version: send msize, then send a message that is too big
- Version: send msize, then read/write data that doesn't fit in msize

- Flush: bogus tag
- Flush: try for valid tag (needs async server)

- Walk: bad chars in names (slash, more?)
- Walk: same fid for old and new
- Walk: send bogus in-use new fid
- Walk: walk to . and .. too, only those or as part of more
- Walk: send more than allowed names?
- Walk: walk from file to other file (invalid)
- Walk: walk from dir to other file (valid)
- Walk: walk from an opened directory (invalid)

- Open: invalid bits in mode
- Open: open an already opened fid

- Create: bad name
- Create: bad bits in permission?
- Create: bad bits in mode
- Create: test create of existing file (should fail)
- Create: create from an open fid

- Read: read at offset 0, read 0 bytes, read past offset.  read more than allowed by msize.  could read at negative offset (for limbo)
- Read: directory,file

- Write: write at negative offset (for limbo).  write 0 bytes.  send message larger han msize.

- Clunk,Stat,Remove: on open/closed fid, file/directory

- Remove: remove with error (e.g. no permission), than verify fid has been clunked.
- Remove: after clunk, ensure fid is gone.

- Wstat: null, for committing to disk
- Wstat: name only
- Wstat: various bits only
- Wstat: various bogus bits, e.g. changing a dir into non-dir and vice-versa.

- send bogus message (invalid), see how remote handles that.  probably closes connection.  should inspect that styx server doesn't crash.
